# Toggle board

Three two-state toggles:
- **AI**
- **Crypto**
- **War in the Middle East**

Rule: at most **two** can be set to **WE’RE SO BACK** at the same time (turning a third on flips the oldest “back” to **IT’S OVER**).

## Run

- Easiest: open `index.html` in a browser.
- Or serve locally:
  - `python3 -m http.server 5173`
  - then visit `http://localhost:5173`
